How to write a flutter desktop application
This was the first video I looked up. Did not end up going too far into it because of API differences but it was useful in the initial steps.

Flutter weather app with API
currently following this. Creator used a hardcoded longitude and latitude. I want to detect user location and get weather based on that
so I used Geolocation and pulled the coordinates from that. I will also be using Geocoding to allow users to search other locations.

Creator did make a model for processing the weather data which is really convenient.
